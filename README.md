# EDA-BankMarketing-Visualization

In this project, we have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Supermarket Sales.

The growth of supermarkets in highly populated cities is increasing, and market competition is also high. This dataset contains historical sales data of a supermarket company recorded across three different branches over three months. Predictive data analytics methods can be easily applied to this dataset.
